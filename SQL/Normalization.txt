Normalization ; when we have a large dataset in a single table which is not feasible to read the proper data
Because multiple columns may or may not belong to each other so Normalization is core database design

It is  a process of decomposing large tables into small tables and columns are also related to each other.


If data is not normalized :
	1- Data redundancy
	2- Update anomalies
	3- Insert anomalies
	4- Delete anomalies 
	So normalization is to organize data to reduce duplication and maintain integrity 
	
	
	A  company stores customer orders details in One table
	
	Orderdata
	
	Orderid 	Customer_name	Customer_phone	Product_names 	Product_prices 	Order_date  
						
	
	
	Problems are :
	Multiple values in one column
	Hard to query individual products
	Data consistency risk
	
	That's why Normalized data can be done by following the rules of 1NF , 2NF ,3 NF …..
	
	1NF say's
	
	Each column has single value ( atomic values)
	No repeating group
	Each row uniquely identifiable
	
	Below is not in 1NF
	
	Orderid 	Customer_name	Customer_phone	Product_names 	Product_prices 	Order_date  
	101	Amit	945453443	Laptop, mouse	70000,500	2026-01-29
						
	102	Rahul	887798798	Keyboard	1200	2026-01-12
	
	After 1NF
	
	Orderid 	Customer_name	Customer_phone	Product_name	Product_prices 	Order_date  
	101	Amit	945453443	Laptop	70000	2026-01-15
	101	Amit	945453443	mouse	500	2026-01-15
	102	Rahul	887798798	Keyboard	1200	2026-01-12
	
	2NF says
	
	It should be in 1 NF first
	No partial dependency 
	(Composite key ) combination of two keys to make a primary key  (name+phone)
	
	Composite key let say  is (order_id , product_name)
	Customer_name depends only on order_id
	Customer_phone depends only on order_id
	Product_price depends only on product_name
	Order_date depends only on order_id
	
	Violation of 2 NF
	
	Orders
	
	Order_id	Customer_name	Customer_phone no 	Order_date
	101	Amit	687987987	2026-01-15
	102	Rahul	343434534	2026-01-12
	
	
	Order_items
	
	Order_id	Product_name	Product_price
	101	Laptop	70000
	101	Mouse	500
	102	Keyboard	1200
	
	3NF says
	
	It should be in 2nf
	No transitive dependency
	 
	• Definition: If 
	𝐴→𝐵,𝐵→𝐶
, then 𝐴→𝐶
 which is a transitive dependency. This usually happens in tables with three or more attributes.
	• Example:
In a Studenttable, Student_ID(Key) →Batch_ID→Batch_Name. The Batch_Namedepends on Batch_ID
, which depends on Student_ID

	• Normalization: To achieve Third Normal Form (3NF), transitive dependencies must be removed to eliminate insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.

To remove transitive dependency

	Customer table
	
	Customer_id	Customer_name	Customer_phone no 
	C1	Amit	687987987
	C2	Rahul	343434534

	
	Orders
	
	Order_id	Customer_id	Order_date
	101	C1	2026-01-15
	102	C2	2026-01-12
	
	Product table
	
	product_id	Product_name	Product_price
	P1	Laptop	70000
	P2	Mouse	500
	P3	Keyboard	1200
	
	
	
	Order_items
	
	Order_id	Product_id
	101	P1
	101	P2
	102	P3


 BCNF -- Sometimee 3NF is also not enough then we have to go for BCNF also 

A table is in BCNF if 
 
Every functional dependency  A->B
Where A must be the super key and generally BCNF eliminates functional dependency anomalies
