Nandhu’s Music World is a fully developed Full Stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
 Music Library application built as a complete capstone project implementing all the requirements specified in the problem statement. 
 This application supports two roles – Admin and User – with secure JWT-based authentication and proper role-based access control.
Users can register, login, logout, browse songs, view detailed information (song name, singer, music director, album, release date), 
search songs using multiple filters, create multiple playlists, perform full CRUD operations on playlists and playlist songs,
and access advanced music controls like play, stop, shuffle, and repeat. Admins have complete control over the music library,
 including CRUD operations on songs, visibility restriction for users, and real-time notification functionality when new songs are added.
The application follows a proper layered architecture with database schema design, controller-service structure, RESTful APIs,
and frontend-backend integration. MongoDB is used for data storage with well-structured collections and relationships.
The frontend is designed as a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) using React Router for seamless navigation without page reloads.
JWT tokens are stored securely in local storage for session handling. Client-side form validations are implemented to ensure data integrity 
and enhance user experience.
Search functionality, playlist management, notification service, and song visibility restriction are completely implemented as per Sprint II 
and Sprint III objectives.
Proper component structure and maintainable code practices are followed across the application
Unit testing and end-to-end testing have been implemented using Mocha, Chai, and Supertest to validate backend APIs and 
ensure system reliability from te user's perspective. The application is fully responsive, user-friendly, and production-ready. 
 All features mentioned in the capstone problem statement have been successfully implemented and integrated into this project.
