E-Commerce Assessment

This project is created as part of my E-Commerce Assessment.
It demonstrates basic frontend development concepts using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript by implementing different user stories.

User Story 1 – Product Listing Page

In this user story, I created a responsive product listing page using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Displayed products such as Laptop, Shoes, and Chair

Used Bootstrap grid system for responsive layout

Added professional styling using custom CSS

Included header, navigation bar, product cards, newsletter section, and footer

Used real product images to improve UI appearance

This page looks like a real e-commerce website and works well on different screen sizes.



User Story 2 – Product Data Handling

In this user story, I handled product data using JavaScript and JSON.

Stored product details in a JSON file

Used JavaScript to read and display data

Implemented basic interaction logic

Displayed output in the browser console

This helped me understand how data can be managed and used dynamically.


User Story 3 – Product Management using TypeScript

In this user story, I used TypeScript concepts.

Created an interface to define product structure

Implemented a class using the interface

Added methods to update product price and stock

Implemented a logging mechanism to track changes

Displayed clean and readable console output

Compiled TypeScript file using tsc and executed JavaScript using Node.js

This user story demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in TypeScript.
